# Partner Account Database

##MVP
Create an accessible interface that lets Code Fellows grads search prospective employers based on:
* location
* stack
* company size
* number of CF grads hired

Crowdsource information for the search tool
* interface for adding company/hiring information
* validation procedure for crowdsourced information

Work priorities
* design search interface
  * allow sorting by above criteria
* create database structure
* clean/fill out data for existing partners
  * (some of this to be outsourced)
* survey alumni network for additional info
  * wait until database is ready
