# Partner Account Database

##MVP

###Create an accessible interface that lets Code Fellows grads search prospective employers based on:
* location
  * radial search?
* stack
  * pick list of tags
* company size
  * categories (e.g. <10, 10-50, etc)
* hiring history
  * hiring category (will/won't/might)
  * number of CF grads hired
  * position(s) hired
  * date of last hire
  * salary
    * avg/range if multiple
  * contact info for hired alum (opt-in)

###Crowdsource information for the search tool
* create interface for adding company/hiring information
* establish validation procedure for crowdsourced information
  * admin backend for manual validation?

###Work priorities
* feel out implementation strategy
  * what stack to use?
    * web app, fully-fleshed out mobile app?
    * data storage requirements - need for server capacity somewhere?
  * how to deploy?
  * team structure
    * how many people do we have?
    * what range of skills/interests?
  * create work timeline based on team recruitment
    * establish frequency of team meetings/check-ins
    * set milestones
* design search interface
  * allow sorting by above criteria
* create database structure
* clean/fill out data for existing partners
  * (some of this to be outsourced)
* survey alumni network for additional info
* contingency plans for event of volunteer team attrition
  * are there circumstances where we would hire developers to get the project done?

###Timeline
* Fri 2/26: initial pitch & recruitment @ CF meetup

###Questions for Dave
* timeline for outsourced data fill-in?
* timeline for overall project completion?
