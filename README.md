###Create an accessible interface that lets Code Fellows grads search prospective employers based on:
* location
  * radial search?
* stack
  * pick list of tags
* company size
  * categories (e.g. <10, 10-50, etc)
* hiring history
  * hiring category (will/won't/might)
  * number of CF grads hired
  * position(s) hired
  * date of last hire
  * salary
    * avg/range if multiple
  * contact info for hired alum (opt-in)

###Crowdsource information for the search tool
* interface for adding company/hiring information
* validation procedure for crowdsourced information

###Work priorities

  * what stack to use?
  * how to deploy?
  * create work timeline based on team recruitment
    * establish frequency of team meetings/check-ins
    * set milestones
* design search interface
  * allow sorting by above criteria
* create database structure
* clean/fill out data for existing partners
  * (some of this to be outsourced)
* survey alumni network for additional info
* contingency plans for event of volunteer team attrition
